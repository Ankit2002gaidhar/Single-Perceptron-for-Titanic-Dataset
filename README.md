- Implementation of Single Perceptron for Titanic Dataset
- Tasks:
- 1. Data Preparation
- 2. Single Perceptron Implementation:
- Write a Python script to implement a single perceptron for binary classification.
- Include functions for initializing weights and bias, calculating the weighted
sum, applying activation function (e.g., step function), and updating weights.
- Test the perceptron on a simple binary classification problem.

- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics
(accuracy, precision, recall).

- 3. Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV:
- Define a grid of hyperparameters for the perceptron (e.g., learning rate, number
of epochs, activation function).
- Use GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
